# Automatic_Ration_System
A project developed during a hackathon aimed at automating ration
distribution across India. Utilizes a PHP-based database for customer
verification and prevents counterfeit weights using a load cell
connected to an Arduino Uno. The Arduino communicates serially with a
Raspberry Pi, while a servo module ensures accurate grain distribution.
